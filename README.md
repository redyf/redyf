### 👋 Hi there!

I'm [Mateus](https://redyf.me), a DevOps engineer.

I like building tools, reproducible environments, and systems that take care of themselves.

I spend most of my time with Nix, Docker, GitHub Actions, Terraform, and Go/Python/TS.
If something can be automated, I’ll probably automate it.

I enjoy reproducible infra, Linux customization, and making DevOps workflows simpler.

Outside of work, I enjoy gaming, going to the gym, listening to music, and contributing to open-source projects.
